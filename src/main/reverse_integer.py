# Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed.
# If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
# Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).
# Constraints:
# -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
